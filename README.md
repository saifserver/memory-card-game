## Introduction

Memory Game aka Concentration, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)>)

## How It Works

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. Each turn:

-   A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
-   The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
-   If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
-   If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
